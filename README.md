# Description
Optimal motion planning is very important to the operation of robot manipulators. Its main target is the generation of a trajectory from start to goal that satisfies objectives, such as minimizing path traveling distance or time interval, lowest energy consumption or obstacle avoidance and satisfying the robotâ€™s kinematics and dynamics. This example shows how to use generalized inverse kinematics to plan a joint-space trajectory for a robotic manipulator. It combines multiple constraints to generate a trajectory that guides the gripper to a cup resting on a table. These constraints ensure that the gripper approaches the cup in a straight line and that the gripper remains at a safe distance from the table, without requiring the poses of the gripper to be determined in advance. We will use a model of the KUKA LBR iiwa, a 7 degree-of-freedom robot manipulator to perform this task. This whole experiment is performed in Matlab using the Robotic system toolbox.
